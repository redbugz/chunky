//! This crate offers an abstraction over allocating fixed-size chunks of memory
//! and different low-level collection types making use of these chunks to emulate
//! "infinite" dynamically growing storages for heterogeneously-sized items.
//!
//! Its purpose is being able to abstract storage of entity-collections
//! (such as actors in `Kay`) over both temporary heap memory and persistent
//! mmap'ed memory used for both runtime and savegames.
